# Quick Start

## Install
1. Open Blender 5.0.
2. Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install.
3. Select the `ai_helper` folder from this repo.
4. Enable the add-on.

## LLM Preview
1. Open View3D > Sidebar > AI Helper.
2. Enter a prompt.
3. Click Preview to generate tool calls.
4. Inspect the preview and click Apply.

## Sketch (WIP)
- Sketch Mode is a stub for now. It will be replaced by a modal sketch tool.

## Notes
- The LLM adapter defaults to mock mode unless a Grok adapter path is set.
- Large mesh data is not sent to the LLM; only selection summaries.
